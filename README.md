# Mindbody + ClassPass - Senior Marketing CRO Developer Test Assessment

Our analysis aims to provide actionable insights and recommendations to enhance the effectiveness of Pichau's conversion funnel. By examining key metrics, identifying areas of improvement, and proposing data-driven solutions, we seek to optimize the user experience and drive measurable increases in conversion rates. 

Through the A/B testing method, we will implement three improvements within the website, with each improvement having its own set of metrics for conversion analysis. 

The focus of the analysis described in this document is to propose improvements within the product page using case studies focused on the market sector of the object. The main tools are described below, as well as case references for each proposition. 

- Figma (Design and UX) 
- HTML, Javascript and CSS (Developing and Stylizing)
